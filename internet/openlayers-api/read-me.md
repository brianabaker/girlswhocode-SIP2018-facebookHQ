Remember when you get to animate you need to show the debugging
"I'm going to do plug and play debugging now"

after pan home we do input a country!

We have to use a different API for this! All openlayers does is give us a map.
We need to use a different API to get the lat and longitudes on user input.

-- do the restcountries stuff

first we have to make an input field

then we have to figure out how to grab what the person is typing in

so now that we know how to get the right URL to use, how do we get the information? The API documentation doesn't really tell us, right? It's because it's RESTful, the way you get the information from it is the same you would other APIs.
